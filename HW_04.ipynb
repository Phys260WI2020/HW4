    "In the last assignment, you used the method of relaxation to find the potential inside a rectangular box, where the potential was specified on the sides. Now, it turns out that we could have solved that particular problem analytically (you will learn how to do this in Physics 405). But the real power of the method of relaxation is that it allows us to study problems that don't have an analytical solution, but occur frequently in the real world. \n",

    "Consider the familiar example of a parallel-plate capacitor. In most physics classes, we pretend that the electric field between the plates can be approximated by the field of two infinite charged planes, so it's constant in between the plates and zero everywhere outside. Here's a typical illustration of this approximation:\n",

    "In reality, this is an idealization, like frictionless surfaces and masssless springs. The approximation works as long as the linear dimensions of the plates are large compared to the separation: $A\\gg d^2$. In this assignment we'll apply this technique to understand what the electric field of a parallel-plate capacitor <i>really</i> looks like, and learn how the usual approximation starts to break down as the plate separation increases.\n",
